### Generate a new index based on specific reference
### The output is a fasta file

## Use "bowtie2-build" command to create a index "a"

bowtie2-build "/home/unhTW/users/cp1153/fasta/a.fa" a


### Alignment by bowtie2

## Use "bowtie2" command to align
## Use "time" command to display the usertime and system time

time bowtie2 --local -x a -U "/home/unhTW/users/cp1153/a.fastq" -S a.sam -p 32

# --local In this mode, Bowtie 2 does not require that the entire read align from one end to the other.
# -x The basename of the index for the reference genome.
# -U Comma-separated list of files containing unpaired reads to be aligned.
# -S File to write SAM alignments to.
# -p Launch NTHREADS parallel search threads.


### Split the paired reads to forward reads and reverse reads by fastq-dump

fastq-dump --split-files "/home/unhTW/users/cp1153/Download/a"


### Do alignment with both forward reads and reverse reads

time bowtie2 --local -x a -1 "/home/unhTW/users/cp1153/a1.fastq" -2 "/home/unhTW/users/cp1153/a2.fastq" -S a.sam -p 32

# -1 -2 Comma-separated list of files containing mate 1s and 2s
